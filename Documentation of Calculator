Calculator Program Documentation

Overview:
This is a simple Python-based command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It allows the user to choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation (power). 
The program handles invalid inputs, such as non-numeric input or division by zero, and provides appropriate feedback.

Program Structure:

1. Functions for Operations
The program uses dedicated functions for each arithmetic operation. These functions take two numbers as arguments and return the result of the operation.

add(x, y):
Adds two numbers (x and y).
Returns: The sum of x and y.

subtract(x, y):
Subtracts the second number (y) from the first number (x).
Returns: The result of x - y.

multiply(x, y):
Multiplies two numbers (x and y).
Returns: The product of x * y.

divide(x, y):
Divides the first number (x) by the second number (y). If y is zero, it returns an error message.
Returns: The quotient of x / y or an error message if division by zero is attempted.

modulus(x, y):
Finds the remainder of the division of x by y.
Returns: The remainder of x % y.

power(x, y):
Raises the first number (x) to the power of the second number (y).
Returns: The result of x ^ y.

2. Main Function: calculator()

The calculator() function serves as the main interface of the program. It performs the following tasks:

Display Options: Prints a menu with six available arithmetic operations for the user to choose from.

Input Handling:
Prompts the user to select an operation by entering a number between 1 and 6.
Prompts the user to input two numbers (operands) for the selected operation.
Ensures that valid numeric inputs are provided by using float() for conversion and handling ValueError for invalid inputs.

Operation Execution:
Based on the user's choice, the appropriate arithmetic function is called and the result is displayed.
Handles division by zero in the divide() function.
Loop: After completing the selected operation, the program ends. No continuous operation is implemented in this version.

Code Walkthrough:

1. Importing Modules
The code does not require any external modules as it uses only built-in Python functions.
2. Operation Functions
Each arithmetic function is written to handle the corresponding operation, taking two numeric inputs and returning the result. For example, add(x, y) returns x + y.
3. Input Validation
The program uses a while loop to ensure that the user selects a valid operation (1–6). Invalid selections result in a prompt to re-enter the operation number.
When taking input for numbers, the program uses float() to convert the input into a number. If the input is not valid (non-numeric), the program catches the ValueError and displays an error message.
4. Division by Zero Handling
The divide() function explicitly checks if the second number (denominator) is zero. If so, it returns a custom error message ("Error: Division by zero is undefined.").

How It Works: 

Start the Program:
When the program is run, it displays a menu with six options for different arithmetic operations.

User Input:
* The user selects the desired operation by entering a number between 1 and 6. If an invalid option is chosen, the program prompts the user to select again.
* The user is then prompted to enter two numbers to perform the selected operation.

Result:The program performs the calculation based on the user’s selection and displays the result of the operation (or an error message, in the case of division by zero or invalid input).

End:Once the operation is completed, the program exits. It does not support continuous calculations in the current implementation.


Error Handling:
* Invalid Operation Selection: If the user enters a value other than 1 through 6, the program repeatedly prompts the user to select a valid option until they do.
* Invalid Numeric Input: If the user enters non-numeric values (e.g., letters) when prompted for numbers, the program catches the ValueError exception and displays an error message without crashing.
* Division by Zero: The divide() function checks for a zero denominator and returns an appropriate error message if division by zero is attempted.
